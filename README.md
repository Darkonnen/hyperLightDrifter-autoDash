# hyperLightDrifter-autoDash
Just a little hacking script to do some job which my stupid hands cannot do.

## About
I use this script on my Ubuntu laptop, but it is easy to migrate to any other platform.

## Usage

First install xdotool.

    sudo apt install xdotool

Open the game and move to the dash house after you learned the dash skill. Set the control mode as keyboard and mouse, run the xdo.py in a terminal by

    python xdo.py

Navigate into the game in five seconds, put your cursor on one of the charger block, and here you go.
